# Attribute-Classification-and-Re-Identification-on-Market-1051-Dataset

In this assignment, we demonstrate the usage of neural networks to solve two common computer vision tasks using the ResNet50 pre-trained model by PyTorch framework. Market-1051 dataset is video-surveillance dataset containing images of multiple persons each of which is captured multiple times by different cameras along with a set of annotations that specify attributes of each person such as age, gender and clothing. The first part of the assignment, we have done multi-class classifier task to predict attributes for each image. In the second part of the assignment, we tried to solve a person re-identification problem using triplet loss.

## Re idendification Part

I used triplet loss for the person re-identification problem.
